\chapter{45IO27 Multi-Function IO Controller}

\section{Overview}

The 45IO27 is a multi-purpose IO controller that incorporates the functions of the
C65's F011 floppy controller, together with the MEGA65's SD card controller interface,
and a number of other miscellation IO functions.

Each of these major functions is covered in a separate section of this chapter

\section{F011-compatible Floppy Controller}

The MEGA65 computer is one of very few modern computers that still
includes first-class support for magnetic floppy drives.  It includes
a floppy controller that is backwards compatible with the C65's F011D
floppy drive controller.

However, unlike the F011D, the MEGA65's
floppy disk controller supports HD and ED media, and similar to the
1541 floppy drive, it also supports variable data rates, so that a
determined user could develop disk formats that store more data,
includ robust copy protection schemes, or both.

GCR encoding is not currently supported, but may be supported by a
future revision of the controller.  It may also be possible with some
creativity and effort to use the debug register interface to read
double-density GCR formatted media.  This is because there are debug
registers that can be queried to indicate the gap between each
successive magnetic domain -- which is sufficient to decode any disk
format. 

\subsection{Multiple Drive Support}

Like the C65's F011 floppy drive controller, the 45IO27 supports up to 8 drives.
The first two of those drives, drive 0 and drive 1, are assumed to be connected to a
standard 34-pin floppy cable, the same as used in standard PCs, i.e.,
with a twist in the cable to allow the use of two unjumpered drives.

As is described in later sections, it is possible to switch drive 0
and drive 1's position, without having to change cabling. Similarly,
either or both of the first two drives may reference a real floppy
drive, a D81 disk image stored on an attached SD card, or redirected
to the floppy drive virtualisation service, so that the sector
accesses can be handled by a connected computer, e.g., as part of a
comfortable and efficient cross-development environment.

The remaining six drives are supported only in conjunction with a
future C1565-compatible external drive port.

\subsection{Reading From Disks}
\label{subsec:reading-from-disks-and-buffer-management}

The 45IO27 support two main modes of reading sectors from a
disk: byte-by-byte, and via a memory-mapped sector buffer.

The byte-by-byte mechanism consists of having a loop wait for the DRQ
signal to be asserted, and then reading the byte of data from the DATA
register (\$D087).

The memory-mapped sector buffer method consists of waiting for the
BUSY flag to clear, indicating that the entire sector has been read,
and then directly accessing the sector buffer located at \$FFD6C00 --
\$FFD6DFF. Care should be taken to ensure that the BUFSEL signal (bit 7 of \$D689) is
cleared, so that the floppy sector buffer is visible, rather than the
SD card sector buffer for programmes other than the Hypervisor. This
is because only the Hypervisor has access to the full 4KiB SD
controller buffer space: Normal programmes see either the floppy
sector buffer or the SD card sector buffer repeated 8 times between
\$FFD6000 and \$FFD6FFF.

Alternatively, the sector buffer can be mapped at \$DE00 -- \$DFFF,
i.e., in the 4KB IO area, by writing the \$81 to the SD command
register at \$D680.  This will hide any IO peripherals that are
otherwise using this area, e.g., from cartridges, or REU emulation.
This function can be disabled again by writing \$82 to the SD command
register. As with the normal sector buffer memory mapping at
\$FFD6xxx, the BUFSEL signal (bit 7 of \$D689) affects whether the FDC
or the SD card sector buffer is visible, for software not running in
Hypervisor mode. 

The memory-mapped sector buffer has the advantage that it can be
accessed via DMA, allowing for very efficient copies.  Also, it allows
for loading a sector to occur in the background, while your programme
gets on with more interesting things in the meantime.

But before you have any data to read, you must first tell the floppy
controller to read a sector.  To do this, first set the SIDE1 flag in
bit 3 of \$D080 if you wish to read a sector from the reverse side of the disk,
or clear it if you wish to read a sector from the first side of the
disk.
Next, load the track, sector and
side number into the TRACK, SECTOR and SIDE registers (\$D084, \$D085
and \$D086, respectively). Then write an appropriate read command
value into \$D080.  This will normally be \$40 (64).  You then wait
for the RDREQ signal (\$D083, bit 7) to go high, to indicate that the
sector has been found. You then either wait for each occassion when
DRQ goes high, and read byte-by-byte in such a loop, or wait for the
BUSY flag to clear and the DRQ and EQ flags to go high, and then
access the sector buffer directly.  

What has not been discussed above is stepping the head to the correct
track.  By default, the 45IO27 uses its ``auto-tune'' function (\$D689,
bit 4) to compare the track number of sectors passing under the head
of the disk drive with the requested track.  If the track matches,
then it knows that it is on the correct track.  If not, it will
periodically seek the head in the direction of the correct track.

This considerably simplifies operation, by relieving the programmer
from having to step the head, and recover from mis-steps, where the
expected and actual tracks diverge. It is therefore recommended that
programmers leave the auto-tune function enabled at all times --
unless you purposely intend to create disks with incorrectly numbered
tracks.

With determination and perserverence, it should be possible
to create disks that use the auto-tune function to play simple tunes.
This is not recommended.

It is also worth noting that the TARGANY signal can be asserted to
tell the floppy controller to simply read the next sector that passes
under the head.  This applies only when using real floppy disks, where
it offers the considerable advantage of letting you read the sectors
in the order in which they exist on the disk. This allows you to read
a track at once, without having to wait for the index hole to pass by,
or having to know which sector will next pass under the head.  In
principle, this allows reading approximately 2 full tracks per second,
i.e., two sides $\times$ two tracks, or approximately 20KiB/second on
DD disks, or double that on HD disks, at around 40KiB/second.  This
compares very favourably with the C65 DOS loading speed, which is
typically nearer 1KiB/sec in C64 mode.

\subsection{Disk Layout and 1581 Logical Sectors}

The 1581 disk format is unusual in that the physical sectors on the
disk are a different size of the size of the data blocks that it
presents to the user.  Specifically, the disks use 512 byte sectors,
while the 1581 (and C65) DOS present 256 byte data blocks.
Two blocks are stored in each physical sector.  Also, the physical
track numbers are from 0 to 79, while the logical track numbers of the
DOS are 1 to 80.  Physical sectors are also numbered from 1 to 10,
while logical block numbers begin are 0 to 39.

This means that if you want to find a 1581 logical sector, you need to
know which physical sector it will be found in.  To determine the
physical sector that contains a block, you first subtract one from the
track number, and then divide the sector number by two.  Logical
sectors 0 to 19 of each track are located in physical sectors 1 to 10
on the first side of the disk.  Logical sectors 20 to 39 are 
located in physical sectors 1 to 10 on the reverse side of the disk.  

Thus we can map a some logical track and sector $t$,$s$ to the
physical track, side and sector as follows:

$track = t - 1$

$sector = (s/2)+1, IFF s < 20, ELSE = ((s-20)/2) + 1$

$side = 0 IFF sector < 20$

It is also worth noting that the 45IO27 is capable of reading from
tracks beyond track 80, provided that the disk drive is capable of
this.  Almost all 3.5 inch floppy drives are capable of reading at
least one extra track, as historically manufacturers of floppy disks
stored information about the disk on the 81st track.  In our
experience almost all drives will also be able to access an 82nd
track.


\subsection{Writing To Disks}

The 45IO27 can write to disk images that are located on the SD card,
or when using virtualised disk access.

However, the current revision of the 45IO27 does not support writing to real
floppy disks.
This will be corrected in a future revision.  However, the determined
user may still be able to write to disks by manipulating the WGATE and
WDATA signals of the \$D6A0 register.  However, this is not
recommended.

To write a sector, you follow a similar process to reading, except
that you write \$84 to the command byte instead of \$40.  The \$80
indicates a write, and the \$04 activates write-precompensation.  This
is important when writing to real floppy disks, especially HD and ED
disks.  Write-precompensation causes bits to be written slightly early
or slightly late, using an algorithm that models how the magnetic
domains on a disk tend to move after being written.

If you do not wish
to use the sector buffer, but instead provide each byte one at a time
during the write operation, you must add \$01 to the command code.
However, this is not recommended on the MEGA65, because when writing
to the SD card or using virtualised disk images the entire sector
operation can happen instantaneously from the perspective of your
programme.  This means that it is not possible to supply data reliably
when in this mode.  Thus apart from being less convenient, it is also
less reliable. 

Once a write operation has been triggered, the DRQ signal indicates
when you should provide the next byte if performing a byte-by-byte
write. Otherwise, it is assumed that you will have pre-filled the
sector buffer with the complete 512 bytes of data required.


\subsection{Using HD, ED Drives and/or variable Data Rates}

The mechanism for using high-density (HD) and extended-density (ED)
media and variable data rates are all identical on the 45IO27:  You
simply set the interval rate (DATARATE) in the \$D6A2 register.

The register is used as a divisor of the system bus frequency
(40.5MHz).  Thus for 1581-compatible double-density (DD) media which
uses a data rate of 500KHz, this register should contain 40.5MHz / 500KHz = 81.

High-density media uses a 1MHz data rate, and thus should contain 40,
and extended-density media with its 2MHz data rate should have this
field set to 20.  Depending on the HD or ED drive used, it may be
necessary to clear or assert the DENSITY signal (\$D6A0 bit 7), or
take other specific ations.  However, in our experience, most HD
drives do not require any manual manipulation of this signal: Instead
simply set the DATARATE register to the correct value, and begin
accessing the disk.

Note that the DATARATE register takes effect instantaneously.  This
means that it is possible to change the data rate for different
tracks, sectors, or even bytes within sectors.

This means that it
would be possible to, for example, use standard 500KHz DD encoding for
the directory track and one data track, and then switch to HD encoding for the other 79
tracks of a disk. The result would be a disk that could contain a
boot-loader programme and directory that can be read in a 1581, and
that could be used to switch to the faster and higher-density HD
encoding for the remaining data tracks.  This could even be done for
half of a disk, so that when used in a 1581, it loads at the DD speed,
but when inserted in a MEGA65, it uses the HD data tracks, allowing
the programme to load twice as fast, and fit twice as much data.

You are really only limited by your imagination, available time, and
the limited number of people who are still interested in inserting a
floppy disk into their computer!

\subsection{F011 Floppy Controller Registers}

The following are the set of F011 compatibility registers of the 45IO47.
Note that registers related to the use of SD-card based storage are found in the corresponding section below.

\input{regtable_FDC.C65}

The following registers apply to the 45IO27 only, i.e., are MEGA65 specific:

\input{regtable_FDC.MEGA65}

\section{SD Card Controller and F011 Virtualisation Functions}

For those situations where you do not wish to use real floppy disks,
the 45IO27 supports two complementary alternative modes:

\begin{itemize}
\item SD-Card Based Disk Image Access.
\item Virtualised Disk Image Access.
\end{itemize}

This is in addition to providing direct access to a dual-bus SD card
interface.

\subsection{SD-Card Based Disk Image Access}

The 45IO27 is both a floppy drive and SD card controller.
This enables it to transparently allow access to D81 disk images
stored on the SD card.  Further, because the controller is combined,
it is possible to still have the floppy drive step and spin as though
it were being used, providing considerable atmosphere and sense of
realism, even when using disk images.

The 45IO27 supports both 800KB standard D81 disk images, as well as
64MiB ``MEGA Images''.  While an operating system may impose
restrictions based on the name of a file, the 45IO27 is blind to these
requirements. Instead, it requires only that a {\tt contiguous} 800KiB
or 64MiB of the SD card is used to contain a disk image.

When a disk image is enabled, the corresponding set of sectors on the
SD card are effectively placed under user control, and the operating
system is no longer able to prevent the reading or writing of any of
those sectors.  Thus you should never enable access to an image that
is shorter than the required size, as it will otherwise allow the user
to unwittingly or maliciously access and/or modify data that is not
part of the image file.

For the same reason, only the hypervisor can change the sector number
where a disk image starts (the D?STARTSEC? signals), or allow the use
of disk images instead of the real floppy drive (USEREAL0 and USEREAL1
signals).  Once the Hypervisor has set the start sector of a disk
image, and cleared the USEREAL0 or USEREAL1 signal, the user can still
controll whether an access will go to the real floppy drive or to the
disk image by respectively clearing or setting the appropriate
signal.  For drive 0, this is D0IMG, and for drive 1, it is D1IMG.

There are also signals to control whether a disk image is an 800KiB
D81 image or a 64MiB MEGA Disk image, and whether a disk image is
present, and whether it is write protected. These are all located in
the \$D68B register. Because of the ability of manipulation of these
registers to corrupt or improperly access data, these signals are all
read-only, except from within the hypervisor.

The following table lists the registers that are used to control
access to disk images resident on the SD card:

\input{regtable_SDFDC.MEGA65}

\subsection{F011 Virtualisation}

In addition to allowing automatic read and write access to SD-card
based D81 images, it is possible to connect a programme to the serial
monitor interface that provides and accepts data as though it were the
floppy disk.

This is commonly used in a cross-development
environment, where you wish to frequently modify a disk image that is
used by a programme you are developing -- without the need to
continually push new versions of the disk image on the MEGA65's
SD-Card first. It also has the added benefit that it allows you to
easily visualise which sectors are being read from and written to,
which can help speed up development and debugging of your programme.

This function operates together with the MEGA65's Hypervisor by
triggering hyperrupts (that is, interrupts that activate the
Hypervisor).  There is then special code in the Hypervisor that
communicates with the {\tt m65} programme via the serial monitor
interface.

If that all sounds rather complex, all you need to know is that to use
this function, you run the {\tt m65} utility with arguments like
{\tt -d image.d81}.  This should automatically establish the link with
the MEGA65.  If the BASIC interprettor stops responding, press the
reset button (not the power switch) on the left side of your MEGA65,
and it should return to the BASIC's {\tt READY.} prompt -- and if your
supplied disk image has a C65 auto-boot function, then it should
automatically start booting.

This function works very well if the host computer runs Linux, and
will allow loading at a speed of around 60KiB per second.  However, it
may be much slower on Windows or Apple OSX-based systems.

Of course to use this, you will also need an interface module and/or
cable to connect your cross-development system to the MEGA65's serial
monitor interface. This is most easily done using a Trenz TE0790-03
JTAG adapter and mini-USB cable.

More information on using this interface and the {\tt m65} tool can be
found in \bookvref{cha:transfer-and-debug-tools}.

\subsection{Dual-Bus SD Card Controller}

The 45IO27 contains a high-speed dual-bus SD card controller.  This
controller operates in SPI x1 mode at a clock speed of 20MHz,
providing a maximum throughput of approximately 2MiB/sec.  The quality
of the SD card makes a signficant difference to performance, with some
cards routinely delivering 1.7MiB/sec, while others 1MiB/sec or
less. Generally speaking, newer cards marketted as being suitable for
video recording perform better.  The controller supports SDHC cards,
and has experimental support for SDXC cards.  Legacy SD cards with a
capacity of 2GiB or less are not supported, as these use a different
addressing mode.

The SD controller itself is very simple to drive: Supply the sector
number in \$D861-\$D684, and then issue a read or write command to the
command register (\$D680).  The SD controller supports only
sector-based buffered operations, using the sector buffer. In
hypervisor mode, the sector buffer is located at \$FFD6E00 --
\$FFD6FFF, while when the computer is in normal operating mode, the SD
card and the floppy controller share a single address for both the
floppy drive and SD card sector buffers. Which buffer is visible at
that address is dictated by the BUFSEL signal. If it is 1, then the SD
card buffer is visible, while if it is 0, then the floppy drive sector
buffer is visible.  See also Sub-section
\vref{subsec:reading-from-disks-and-buffer-management} for further
discussion on the precise behaviour of this buffer with regard to
normal mode versus Hypervisor mode, and how it can also be mapped at
\$DE00. 

\subsubsection{Write Gate}

When writing a sector, you must, however, first open the ``write
gate''. This is a mechanism to prevent accidental corruption of data
on the SD card, as it requires two different values to be written to
the command register (\$D680) in quick succession: You have
approximately 1 milli second after opening the write gate to command
the write, before the write gate effectively closes again,
write-protecting the SD card until the write gate is opened again.
There are two different write gates: One for the master boot record
(sector 0), and the other for all other sectors, both of which are
listed in the command table below. This is designed to provide
additional protection to the very important master boot record sector
against programmes accidentally calculating sector 0 as the target for
an ordinary write.

\subsubsection{Fill Mode}

Where you wish to fill sectors with a constant value, the 45IO27
supports a mode for this, so that you do not need to overwrite the
contents of the sector buffer. This is activated by placing the
desired fill value into the FILLVAL register (\$D686), and then
issuing the enable fill mode command (\$83), performing the sector
write operations, and then issuing the disable fill mode command
(\$84). 

\subsubsection{Selecting Among Multiple SD Cards}

The controller supports two SD Card interfaces, and it is possible to
have a card in both at the same time.  However, each card needs to be
reset and commanded separately.  Only one card can be commanded at a
time.  That said, it is possible to reset each card once, and then
switch between the cards to perform individual operations.

To select the first SD Card slot, write \$C0 to the SD Controller
Command Register (\$D680).  To select the second SD Card slot, write
\$C1 instead.

\subsubsection{SD Controller Command Table}

The SD controller supports the following commands that can be written
to the command register at \$D680:

\setlength{\tabcolsep}{3pt}
\begin{longtable}{|L{2.4cm}|L{8cm}|}

   \end{longtable}


Note that the hypervisor can enable or disable direct access to the SD
controller. The hypervisor operating system may provide a mechanism
for requesting permission to access the SD card controller, e.g., for
disk management utilities.

The SD card controller registers are as follows:

\input{regtable_SD.MEGA65}

\section{Touch Panel Interface}

Some MEGA65 variants include an LCD touch panel, primarily the
MEGAphone hand-held version of the MEGA65.  The touch interface
supports the detection of two simultaneous touch events.  Some
variants may also support gesture detection, however, this is still
very experimental.

The touch detection interface that is contained in the 45IO27 is
complemented by the on-screen-keyboard interface of the 4551 UART and
GPIO controller.  Refer to \bookref{sec:uartmisc} for further
information.  Of particular relevance are bit 7 of the registers \$D615 --
\$D617 which allow activating the on-screen keyboard interface,
selecting whether the on-screen keyboard is placed in the upper or
lower portion of the screen, and whether the primary or secondary
on-screen keyboard is displayed.

Direct connections between the 4551 and the 45IO27 combine information
about any currently displayed on-screen keyboard and the touch
interface controller, allowing synthetic keyboard events to be
automatically triggered when the on-screen keyboard portion of the
touch interface is pressed.  This allows the touch interface to be
used to drive the on-screen keyboard without requiring any support
from user programmes. This works even when the on-screen keyboard is
moving during activation or transitioning between the top and bottom
of the screen.

As touch interfaces can require calibration, the 45IO27 allows for a
linear transformation of both the X and Y coordinates of a touch
event.  Specifically, there are scale (TCHXSCALE and TCHYSCALE) and
offset registers (TCHXDELTA and TCHYDELTA) that provide for this
transformation. It is also possible to flip the touch screen
coordinates in either or both the X and Y axes.  These calibration
registers also affect the operation of the on-screen keyboard.

It should also be noted that some touch interfaces do not have
constant horizontal or vertical resolution. For example, some panels
have a low horizontal resolution region in the middle of the panel,
which can require some care to accommodate.

To detect the primary touch event, the TOUCH1XLSB, TOUCH1XMSB, TOUCH1YLSB,
TOUCH1YMSB registers can be read.  Similar registers exist for the 2nd
touch event: TOUCH2XLSB, TOUCH2XMSB, TOUCH2YLSB, TOUCH2YMSB. Each
touch event has a signle bit flag that indicates whether the touch
event is currently valid: the EV1 and EV2 bits of the register
\$D6B0.  There are also corresponding bit-fields that indicate whether a
given touch event has been made or released, allowing the detection of
when a finger both makes and breaks contact with the screen.  The
UPDN1 and UPDN2 signals provide this information.  Binary values of 01 and
10, respectively indicate if the finger has been removed or pressed
against the touch panel.  Values of 00 and 11 mean that a finger is
either being held or not being held against the touch panel.

The
primary touch event is also fed into the lightpen\index{light pen} input of the VIC-IV,
and can be detected using the normal light pen registers of the VIC-IV.

The registers for the touch panel interface are as follows:

\input{regtable_TOUCH.MEGA65}
