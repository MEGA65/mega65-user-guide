\section{Introduction}
A part of the MEGA65 is the system program called Hyppo that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Boots the MEGA65.
  \item Loads the ROMs and other files from the SD card.
  \item Makes memory banks 2 and 3 ROM-like by protecting them from being
        written to.
  \item Virtualises the floppy disk controller so you can use disk images.
  \item Launches various utilities like the freezer and the Matrix Mode
        Debugger.
  \item Provides services specific to the MEGA65 that you can use in your
        programs.
\end{itemize}

If you know about hypervisors and virtual machines, Hyppo is a very limited
hypervisor. Don't expect to be able to run multiple virtual machines
concurrently with full isolation. Hyppo runs things that are more akin to the
task and processes of a modern operating system than the virtual machines of a
hypervisor as you might know it.

Hyppo provides 3 operating modes.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The C64-like operating mode} runs C64 programs and MEGA65
        programs that run in the MEGA65's C64 mode. When you boot with
        \megasymbolkey pressed or use the \textbf{GO64} command, Hyppo
        starts a process in the C64-like operating mode to run BASIC 2 or the
        MEGA65 program.
  \item \textbf{The C65-like operating mode} is the MEGA65's normal operating
        mode. This is where regular MEGA65 program run, including BASIC 65
        programs.
  \item \textbf{The MEGA65 operating mode} runs the MEGA65's system programs
        like the freezer, the configuration utility and the Matrix Mode
        Debugger. Maybe surprisingly, normal MEGA65 programs do not run in the
        MEGA65 operating mode. They run in the C65-like operating mode. The
        MEGA65 operating mode is designed solely for the MEGA65 and does not
        attempt to be compatible with or even be similar to previous systems.
\end{itemize}

Unlike on the C128, it is possible for a program to effectively change the
operating mode while it's is running, by simply enabling or disabling the
various hardware features.

\filbreak
Hyppo provides very limited virtualisation of the MEGA65's hardware. It can
virtualise the floppy controller. There are plans to virtualise the serial bus
so the MEGA65 can use disk images for units like the 1541.

There are some parts of the hardware that only Hyppo can access. It is the only
component that can directly access the internal and external SD cards. You need
to use Hyppo's services if you want to access the files and directories on the
SD cards from within your programs.

\subsection{Terminology}

When you start to learn about Hyppo, there can be some terminology that might be
confusing if you already know about other parts of the MEGA65.

On the SD card there is likely to be a file called HICKUP.M65. This file updates
Hyppo to new versions without having to install an upgraded core. You might find
occasions where Hyppo might be called Hickup because of this strong association.

There are 3 distinct disk operating systems in the MEGA65.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Inside Hyppo is Hyppo DOS, or HDOS for short. HDOS is for accessing
        the FAT32 file system on the SD cards. HDOS does not know anything
        about Commodore file systems. It can attach an image of a Commodore
        file system, but it does not understand what is inside the image.
  \item Inside the Kernal is CBDOS. CBDOS is for accessing 1581-like file
        systems. CBDOS uses the 45IO27 multi-function I/O controller to access
        the sectors of a physical disk. CBDOS does not know anything about SD
        cards and the FAT32 file system on them. Hyppo virtualises part of the
        45IO27 so CBDOS can access disk images like they're physical disks.
  \item The external disk units attached to the serial bus each have their own
        DOS. They are used for accessing the file systems on their respective
        physical disks.
\end{itemize}

The word drive means different things for each of these DOS's.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The drives in Hyppo are the partitions of the internal and external SD
        cards. When the MEGA65 boots, Hyppo assigns numbers to the partitions
        it can read.
  \item The drives in CBDOS are the physical disk drives attached to the 45IO27
        multi-function I/O controller --- such as the internal disk drive ---
        or the disk images attached to the virtualised 45IO27. The CBDOS drives
        are normally seen as units 8 and 9.
  \item The drives in an external unit attached to the serial bus are the
        disk drives inside that unit.
\end{itemize}

\filbreak
\subsection{Versions}

This chapter describes the services available in Hyppo 1.2.

New Hyppo services may become available and existing Hyppo services may change
or be deprecated. A robust program will use the \nameref{hyppo:getversion}
service to check whether it is compatible with the Hyppo in the MEGA65 it's
running on.

% Jimbo - Do we commit to semantic versioning? Do we have a deprecation policy?

\subsection{Using}
When you want to use a Hyppo service, you don't use JSR. This is because
Hyppo exists in a space that's separate from regular code. In order to
access it, the CPU needs to switch into its hypervisor mode.

At addresses \$D640 -- \$D67F are a set of hypervisor traps. Writing to these
addresses are not like writing to other addresses. Instead of writing to memory
or I/O, the CPU switches into the hypervisor mode and starts a Hyppo service.
How the CPU does this is described in \bookvref{cha:cpu}.

Which Hyppo service starts depends on what value from the A register you
write and which trap you write to. Each of the services described in this
chapter tells you what value to write and which trap to use. You have to use the
A register when triggering a trap. Writing the same value from another register
won't work.

When the Hyppo service finishes, the CPU will switch back to your program.
Except for the registers a service uses to return values, the registers are
otherwise preserved.

\textbf{Important} The CPU may or may not execute the next byte in your
program after the Hyppo service finishes. Put a CLV instruction after the STA.
The CPU executing the CLV or not shouldn't matter to your program. If your
program does rely on the V flag, you can use the NOP instruction instead. When
you use NOP you must be mindful of when the CPU interprets the NOP as a prefix
for the following instruction. For this reason, you should prefer using CLV
over NOP.

\subsection{Errors}
\index{Hyppo Error Codes}

If the service was successful, it will set the C flag.

If the service was unsuccessful, it will clear the C flag and put an error code
in the A register. There is a table of error codes in the description for
\nameref{hyppo:geterrorcode}.

\subsection{Examples}
The examples use the ACME assembler. The ACME assembler is not required. The
Hyppo services can be used with any assembler.

The examples are often not complete. They assume an error handler called error
is defined somewhere. They also assume a transfer area has been defined
somewhere. \nameref{hyppo:setuptransferarea} and \nameref{hyppo:setname}
show how to define a transfer area.

% Jimbo - These should be named as what they are, partitions.
%         This would resolve potential confusion when we do start referring
%         to the virtual F011's drive 0 and 1 around mounting disk images.

In Hyppo, drives are the partitions of the internal and external SD cards.
They are not the drive 0 and drive 1 of the F011 floppy controller. They
are also not the drive 0 and drive 1 of dual-drive units attached to the serial
bus.

\item [Service:]
  Changes the current working directory.
\item [Preconditions:]
  The FAT dir entry for the directory you want to change to has been
  found. \hypporef{findfile} is typically used to find a FAT dir entry.
  \hypporef{findfirst}, \hypporef{findnext} and \hypporef{readdir} can also be
  used.
\item [Errors:]

  directory. Bit 4 of the FAT dir entry's attribute byte is set for
  directories.}
\item [History:]
  \availablefrom{1.2}
\item [Remarks:]
  You can move up to the parent directory by finding the .. FAT dir entry.

  You cannot move up or down more than one directory at a time.

  Use \hypporef{cdrootdir} to directly change back to the root directory.
\item [Example:]
  Changes to an arbitrary path on the current drive. Call with Y:X being the
  address of the path. The last character of each component in the path needs
  to have bit 7 set. The whole path is terminated with a \$00. For example,
  to change into DIR1 and then DIR2 the path would be
  {\codefont !text "DIR", '1'+\$80, "DIR" '2'+\$80, 0}.

  If successful, returns with the C flag set. If some part of the path doesn't
  exist, returns with the C flag cleared and the current working directory will
  be whatever directory was last successfully navigated to.

  % Jimbo - Why does Hyppo do this and create this restriction?
  Hyppo will only find files whose long filename is all in uppercase.
  Hyppo converts the current filename to ASCII uppercase before trying
  to match it. Bytes \$61 -- \$7B change to \$41 -- \$5A.

  Hyppo does not yet support the wildcard characters * and ?. Support
  for that is planned in a future version.

  This only finds the first matching file. You can find multiple matches by

  If Hyppo finds an initial matching file, it will set the C flag and

  reading the current working directory. You are responsible for closing it
  using \hypporef{closedir}. It's a standard directory file descriptor. You
  can use \hypporef{readdir} to read the FAT dir entries after the file that
  was found.

  If Hyppo doesn't find any matching files, it will fail with a file
  not found error. In this case Hyppo will have already closed the
  file descriptor and you don't have to close it.

  % Jimbo - Why does Hyppo do this and create this restriction?
  Hyppo will only find files whose long filename is all in uppercase.

  To access the data, you need to either:

          \$FFD6E00 -- \$FFD6FFF into a buffer already mapping into the 16-bit
          address space; or
    \item use 32-bit load instructions to access the sector buffer directly.
  \end{itemize}

  If a full sector was read, Y:X will be \$0200. For the last sector of the
  file, Y:X may be less than that. Any bytes in the sector buffer after Y:X are
  undefined and will not necessarily be zero.

  If you read past the end of the last sector, Y:X will be \$0000, the A
  register will be \$FF and the C flag will be set.

  While multiple files can be opened simultaneously, only the current file can
  be read. The current file is often the last file opened, but not always.

  Maps the sector buffer to \$DE00 and then reads each sector of the file

\section{Disk Image Services}

The 45IO27 multi-function I/O controller includes a F011-compatible floppy
controller. The internal floppy drive is attached to this as drive 0.

Hyppo can virtualise the F011 floppy controller so that disk images
can be attached instead of floppy drives. Once a disk image is attached,
Hyppo traps the F011's I/O registers and emulates the commands on the disk
image.

You can use BASIC, the Kernal and the F011 I/O registers to operate on a disk
image just as you would a physical disk. The virtualisation does not behave the
same as a floppy drive in all cases. If you intend for your program to work
with both disk images and physical disks, be sure to test it with both.
