\section{SID Registers}

The MEGA65 has 4 SIDs build in, which can be access through the register ranges
starting at \$D400, \$D420, \$D440, and \$D460. The registers in each of these ranges are
exactly the same, so the following table only lists the first SID. Add 32 the get to
the next SID respectively.
