    \subsection{No lights when powering on}
    If there are occasions when your MEGA65 display any lights when powering on, they relate to having certain HDMI devices plugged in while the MEGA65 is off, that don't provide enough power for the keyboard's CPLD to be properly powered on, but enough to stop it properly resetting when the MEGA65 powers on. Removing the HDMI cable and turning the machine off and on again fixes the issue.

INFO: [Synth 8-256] done synthesizing module 'ram32x1024' [/home/....]
INFO: [Synth 8-256] synthesizing module 'charrom' [/home/....]
    /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2019.2/bin/loader: line 280: 2317 killed
    WARNING: [Vivado 12-8222] Failed run(s) : 'synth\_1'
        ERROR: Application Exception: failed to launch run 'impl\_1' due to failures in the following run(s):
        synth\_1
        These failed run(s) need to be reset prior to launching 'impl\_1' again.
    \end{lstlisting}
    \end{tcolorbox}
This error is due to vivado crashing because the machine doesn't have enough RAM for vivado to run.
Vivado requires at least 4GB to synthesise the MEGA65 target, but 8GB is better.

\section{mega65\_ftp}
    \subsection{Missing Library}
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black,coltext=white]
\begin{lstlisting}
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lncurses
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
Makefile:474: recipe for target 'bin/mega65_ftp' failed
make: *** [bin/mega65_ftp] Error 1\end{lstlisting}
    \end{tcolorbox}
This error occurs when the ncurses library is missing from the computer when building the mega65\_ftp program.
To rectify this issue you will need to ensure that you install this dependency.

    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black,coltext=white]
\begin{lstlisting}
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev\end{lstlisting}
    \end{tcolorbox}
