Now that everything is connected, it's time to get familiar with the MEGA65 keyboard.

You may notice that the keyboard is a little different from the keyboards used on computers today. While most keys will be in familiar positions, there are some specialised keys, and some with special graphic symbols marked on the front.

Here's a brief description of how some of these special keys function.

\subsection{Command Keys}

The Command Keys are: \specialkey{RETURN}, \specialkey{SHIFT}, \specialkey{Ctrl}, \megasymbolkey and \widekey{RESTORE}.

\subsubsection{RETURN}

Pressing the \specialkey{RETURN} key enters the information you have typed into the MEGA65's memory. The computer will either act on a command, store some information, or display an error message if you made a mistake.

\subsubsection{SHIFT}

The two \specialkey{SHIFT} keys are located on the left and the right. They work very much like the Shift key on a regular keyboard, however they also perform some special functions as well.

In upper case mode, holding down \specialkey{SHIFT} and pressing any key with a graphic symbol on the front produces the right-hand symbol on that key. For example, \specialkey{SHIFT} and \megakey{J} prints the \graphicsymbol{J} character.

In lower case mode, pressing \specialkey{SHIFT} and a letter key prints the upper case letter on that key.

Finally, holding down the \specialkey{SHIFT} key and pressing a Function key accesses the function shown on the front of that key. For example: \specialkey{SHIFT} and \megakey{F1} activates \textbf{F2}.


\subsubsection{SHIFT LOCK}

In addition to the Shift key is \specialkey{SHIFT\\LOCK}. Press this key to lock down the Shift function. Now any key you press while the Shift Lock key is illuminated prints the character to the screen as if you were holding down \specialkey{SHIFT}. This includes special graphic characters.

\subsubsection{CTRL}

\specialkey{CTRL} is the Control key. Holding down \specialkey{CTRL} and pressing another key allows you to perform Control Functions. For example, holding down \specialkey{CTRL} and one of the number keys allows you to change text colours. The colour that is printed at the top row on the front of the number key will be used.

There are some examples of this in \bookvref{sec:screen-editor}, and all the Control Functions are listed in \bookvref{appendix:controlcodes}.

If a program is being LISTed to the screen, holding down \specialkey{CTRL} slows down the display of each line.

Holding \specialkey{CTRL} and pressing \megakey{*} enters the Matrix Mode Debugger.

\subsubsection{RUN/STOP}

Normally, pressing the \specialkey{RUN\\STOP} key stops execution of a program. Holding \specialkey{SHIFT} while pressing \specialkey{RUN\\STOP} loads the first program from disk.

Programs are able to disable the \specialkey{RUN STOP} key.

You can boot your MEGA65 into the machine code monitor by holding down \specialkey{RUN\\STOP} and pressing reset on the left-hand side.

\subsubsection{RESTORE}

The computer screen can be restored to a clean state without clearing the memory by holding down the \specialkey{RUN\\STOP} key and pressing \widekey{RESTORE}. This combination also resets operating system vectors and re-initialises the screen editor, which makes it a handy combination if the computer has become a little confused.

Programs are able to disable this key combination.

You can also enter the Freeze Menu by holding down \widekey{RESTORE} for more than one second. You can then access the machine code monitor via the Freeze menu.

\subsubsection{THE CURSOR KEYS}

At the bottom right-hand side of the keyboard are the cursor keys. These four directional keys allow you move the cursor to any position for on-screen editing.

The cursor moves in the direction indicated on the keys: \megakey{$\leftarrow$} \megakey{$\uparrow$} \megakey{$\rightarrow$} \megakey{$\downarrow$}

However, it is also possible to move the cursor up using \specialkey{SHIFT} and \megakey{$\downarrow$}. In the same way you can move the cursor left using \specialkey{SHIFT} and \megakey{$\rightarrow$}.

You don't have to keep pressing a cursor key over and over. If you need to move the cursor a long way, you can keep the key pressed down. When you are finished, simply release the key.

\subsubsection{INSerT/DELete}

This is the INSERT / DELETE key. When pressing \specialkey{INST\\DEL}, the character to the left is deleted, and all characters to the right are shifted one position to the left.

To insert a character, hold the \specialkey{SHIFT} key and press \specialkey{INST\\DEL}. All the characters to the right of the cursor are shifted to the right. This allows you to type a letter, number or any other character into the newly inserted space.


\subsubsection{CLeaR/HOME}

Pressing the \specialkey{CLR\\HOME} key returns the cursor into the top left-most position of the screen.

Holding down \specialkey{SHIFT} and pressing \specialkey{CLR\\HOME} clears the entire screen and places the cursor into the top left-most position of the screen.

\subsubsection{MEGA KEY}

The \megasymbolkey key or the MEGA key provides a number of different functions and can be used to launch special utilities.

Holding the \specialkey{SHIFT} key and pressing \megasymbolkey switches between lower and upper-case character modes.

Holding \megasymbolkey and pressing any key with graphic symbols on the front prints the left-most graphic symbol to the screen.

Holding \megasymbolkey and pressing any key that shows a single graphic symbol on the front prints that graphic symbol to the screen.

Holding \megasymbolkey and pressing a number key switches to one of the colours in the second range. The colour that is printed at the bottom row on the front of the number key will be used.

Holding \megasymbolkey and pressing \specialkey{TAB} enters the Matrix Mode Debugger.

Switching on the MEGA65 or pressing the reset button on the left-hand side while holding down \megasymbolkey switches the MEGA65 into C64 mode.

\subsubsection{NO SCROLL}
If a program is being LISTed to the screen, pressing \specialkey{NO\\SCROLL} freezes the screen output. This feature is not available in C64 mode.


\subsection{Function Keys}

There are seven Function keys available for use by software applications, \megakey{F1} \megakey{F3} \megakey{F5} \megakey{F7} \megakey{F9} \megakey{F11} and \megakey{F13} can be used to perform functions with a single press.

Hold \specialkey{SHIFT} to access \megakey{F2} through to \megakey{F14} as shown on the front of each Function key.

Only Function keys \megakey{F1} to \megakey{F8} are available in C64 mode.

\subsubsection{HELP}

The \specialkey{HELP} key can be used by software and acts as an \megakey{F15} / \megakey{F16} key.

\subsubsection{ALT}

Holding \specialkey{ALT} down while pressing other keys can be used by software to perform functions. Not available in C64 mode.

Holding \specialkey{ALT} down while switching the MEGA65 on activates the Utility Menu. You can format an SD card, or enter the MEGA65 Configuration Utility to select the default video mode and other settings, or test your keyboard.

\subsubsection{CAPS LOCK}

The \specialkey{CAPS\\LOCK} works like \specialkey{SHIFT\\LOCK} in C65 and MEGA65 modes, but only modifies the alphabet keys.
Also, holding the \specialkey{CAPS\\LOCK} key down forces the processor to run at the maximum speed. This can be used, for example,
to speed up loading from the internal disk drive or SD card, or to greatly speed up the de-packing process after a program is run.
This can reduce the loading and de-packing time from many seconds to as little as a fraction of a second.
