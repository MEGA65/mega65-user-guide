MEGA65 Images were exported from Blender using the Freestyle SVG Export plugin.
Then imported into Inkscape for minor cleanup. Line width changed to 2px.

Additional illustrations like mega65-top and the Nexys diagrams were also designed using Inkscape. These are then exported as PDFs for importing into the various manuals. The svg files also give hints as to fonts and line heights used.
