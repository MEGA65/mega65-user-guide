Rotate Right Quad
M $\leftarrow$ M$\gg$1, C $\leftarrow$ M(0), M(31) $\leftarrow$ C or Q $\leftarrow$ Q$\gg$1, C $\leftarrow$ Q(0), Q(31) $\leftarrow$ C
N+Z+C+M+
This instruction shifts either the Q pseudo register or contents
of the provided memory location one bit right.  Bit 31 will be
set to the current value of the Carry Flag, and the bit 0 will be shifted out into the Carry Flag

Note that the address is treated as the first address of a little-endian 32-bit value.

\subsubsection*{Side effects}
\begin{itemize}
\item The N flag will be set if the result is negative, i.e. has it's most significant bit set, otherwise it will be cleared.
\item The Z flag will be set if the result is zero, otherwise it will be cleared.
\item The C flag will be set if bit 31 of the value was set, prior to being shifted, otherwise it will be cleared.
\end{itemize}
