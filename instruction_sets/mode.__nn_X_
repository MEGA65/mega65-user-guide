MEM(<(1+X+B1)):MEM(<(0+X+B1))
Base-page indirect, pre indexed by X register
This addressing mode uses the address at the Xth entry of
a look-up table located at the base-page address indicated by
the argument.  

For example, LDA (\$12,X) would load the accumulator from
the address whose low byte is read from (\$12 + X) and whose
high-byte is read from (\$12 + 1 + X).  For example, if X held
the value \$04, the address would be read from \$16 and \$17.
If location \$16 held \$34 and location \$17 held \$12, then
A would be loaded with the contents of location \$1234. 

NOTE: The X indexing stage adjusts only the lower-byte of the
address. That is, the look-up table must be entirely located
in the base-page.

NOTE: This instruction always forms 16-bit addresses using
pairs of bytes. This means that ordinarily X should hold an
even value. This allows the use of look-up tables with up to
128 entries.
