PC+B2:B1
The argument to this address is an 16-bit relative address that is used
to compute the target branch address. This allows branches to any location in
the processor's 64KB memory window.

For example, BNE \$2000 would branch to location \$2000 if the zero flag is cleared,
and where the instruction could be placed anywhere in memory, regardless of its proximity
to location \$2000.
