\begin{enumerate}
	\item The MEGA65 includes an internal 3.5" floppy disk drive. You can also connect older Commodore{\textregistered} IEC serial floppy drives to the MEGA65, such as the Commodore 1541, 1571 or 1581. To use these drives, connect one end of an IEC cable to the Commodore floppy disk drive and the other end to the Disk Drive socket of the MEGA65. You can also connect SD2IEC devices and Pi1541's. It is also possible to daisy-chain additional floppy disk drives or Commodore compatible printers.
	\item You can connect your MEGA65 to an Ethernet network using a standard Ethernet cable.
	\item For enjoying audio from your MEGA65, you can connect a 3.5mm stereo mini-jack cable to an audio amplifier or speaker system. If your system has RCA connectors you will need a 3.5mm mini-jack to twin RCA adapter cable. The MEGA65 also has a built-in amplifier to allow the use of headphones.
	\item A microSD card (either SDHC or SDXC) can be inserted into the external microSD card slot at the rear of the MEGA65.
    \item Underneath the MEGA65, you will find an opening/trapdoor that provides access to the internal SD card slot, and also two PMOD connecters that allow for future possible hardware expansions such as Tape adapters, Userport interfaces, extra memory, or even real SIDs.

\subsection{THE CURSOR}

The flashing square underneath the \screentext{READY} prompt is called the cursor. The cursor indicates that the computer is ready to accept input. Pressing keys on the keyboard will print their respective characters onto the screen. The characters will be printed at the current cursor position, and the cursor will advance to the next position after every key press.
