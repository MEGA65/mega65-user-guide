\pagenumbering{arabic}

The following is wrong, because the reverse-heart symbol appears BEFORE
the double-quote, even though in the source it comes after it:
\begin{screenoutput}
2 PRINT "ƳGUESS THE NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100"
\end{screenoutput}

And it doesn't matter how many of them we put in there:
\begin{screenoutput}
2 PRINT "ƳƳƳƳƳƳƳGUESS THE NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100"
\end{screenoutput}

But if I put a ``normal'' character, then everything magically ends up in the right order:

\begin{screenoutput}
2 PRINT " ƳGUESS THE NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100"
\end{screenoutput}

And to add to the mystery, if I add an accented characte BEFORE the symbol, then the reverse
heart appears before that, but after the quote.

\begin{screenoutput}
2 PRINT "öƳGUESS THE NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100"
\end{screenoutput}

It seems that the double-quotes and ö are in the same category of symbols for this problem.

Having multiple such characters doesn't help: The reverse heart goes before the whole run
of them:

\begin{screenoutput}
2 PRINT "ööööööƳGUESS THE NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100"
\end{screenoutput}

Same for double quote:

\begin{screenoutput}
2 PRINT ""ƳGUESS THE NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100"
\end{screenoutput}

So it seems the symbol moves to before the immediately preceding character of the affected class.

\begin{screenoutput}
2 PRINT ö"ƳGUESS THE NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100"
\end{screenoutput}
